<h1>Bansync</h1>
<p>
    MTA bansyc is a project to be able to synchronize bans between multiple servers.
</p>
<p>
    The main goal of bansync is to create a community where servers can contribute to keeping
    each other's servers clear of undesired players.
</p>
<h2>Signing up</h2>
<p>
    In order to get started you can sign up for a server account <a href="https://bans.nanobob.net/signup">here</a>.
    After you create a server account you can instantly start contributing to the
    database of banned players. You will also be able to keep the players in the bansync database
    from playing on your server by implementing the bansync lua resource, or code snippet.<br>
    More info on how to implement bansync can be found on the management dashboard after you have signed up.
</p>
<h2>Abuse prevention</h2>
<p>
    In order to prevent abusive use of the system any server can specify which other server's bans
    they also want to enforce on their server. So make sure you specify those you think can be trusted.<br>
    You will also be able to specify for what types of bans you want to ban people, on a per server basis.<br>
    Valid options are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cheating / hacking</li>
    <li>Bug abuse</li>
    <li>Unwanted advertising</li>
    <li>Abusive behaviour</li>
    <li>Ban evasion</li>
    <li>General rule breaking</li>
</ul>
<h2>Verified servers</h2>
<p>
    As a server you can also apply to become a verified server. A verified server doesn't have
    more power or abilities than regular servers. The only difference is that a server will be able
    to mass specify what type of bans to follow for all verified servers.<br>
    In order to become verified you must apply <a href="https://bans.nanobob.net/verification">here</a>.
    Make sure to be logged in as a server account in order to request your verification.
    Any currently verified server can contribute to the voting for server verification.
